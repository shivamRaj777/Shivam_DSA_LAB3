The project contains two questions where q1 is related to stack  and q2 is related to BST pair sum.
Q1. Wap for balancing brackets, using a suitable data structure to print whether the string entered is a balanced or unbalanced string.
                i. Stack was used for this problem.
Q2. Find a pair with a given sum in the binary search tree:
                i.Creation of BST.
                ii. Bst traversal .
                iii. print in order.
                iii. if the sum of node values matches with the target sum then print the pair of nodes.
